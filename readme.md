<h3>Hello stranger!</h3>

âœ¨ I am Vaclav - a former cook who turned Web Developer, nice to meet you. 

<p>â†’ Currently polishing my recently deployed project BobbleHeads "https://bobbleheads.vercel.app".<br> 
â†’ Made with MERN-Stack: React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB & Tailwind CSS. Front: TS | Back: JS .<br>

<p>BobbleHeads app is a satirical e-commerce app, which is mocking politicians, powerful people<br>
and selling their BobbleHead figures. The project shows my capability to create and deploy<br>
a fully responsive e-commerce app with it's basic features and custom made API and items.<br>
At the moment it only needs to improve loading times as it's a bit slow.<br>
The product images are custom made with AI. It is my second full stack project made with MERN.

<p>â†’ My first finished MERN stack project is 'Curated-Recipes' "https://curated-recipes.vercel.app".<br>
â†’ React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB & Tailwind CSS. Front: TS | Back: JS .<br>

<p> Curated-Recipes app is a recipes database app, where user can search, filter,<br> 
save/like and create his own recipes. The project shows my experience with MERN stack<br>
and working with a custom made API database with it's essential features.

Tech-Stack I focus on:

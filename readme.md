<h3>Hello stranger!</h3>

âœ¨ I am Vaclav - a Web Developer based in Berlin, nice to meet you. 

<p>Currently working on my most recent project "BobbleHeads - twisted e-commerce".<br> 
It is made with MERN-Stack: React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, TS.<br>

<p>It is a satirical e-commerce style webshop, which is<br> 
selling funny figures of politicians and powerful people.<br>
Product images are custom made with AI.<br>
The app is functional, but still needs some styles polishing,<br>
better responsivness, few extra features and a deployment.</p>

You can check the repos under this intro

Tech-Stack I focus on:

## Hey there stranger!

Let me introduce myself, I am Vaclav ðŸ‘‹ a Junior Web Developer based in Berlin.

Iâ€™m currently working on my most recent project "BobbleHeads", 
which still needs some polishing, better responsivness and a deployment.
It is a satirical e-commerce style webshop, 
selling funny figures of politicians and powerful people.
